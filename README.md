# RedEdit
The goal of this project is to abstract the network and simplify complex instructions. RedEdit allows for cross server code execution and data synchronization. This allows for new server instances (for load balancing) to be started on an as needed bases, each with the same data set and functionality. All servers within a server group will serve the same function (this can be configured in the config.yml). 

Redis is used for cross server code execution. This project currently supports Spigot or ~~Sponge~~(wip)  servers running on Bungee or Lilypad network. Objects are serialized and compressed when transmitted using LZ4.
 
Misc functionality:
 - Player tracking / teleporting between nodes / user configs.
 - PlotSquared synchronization
 - Dynamic rendering based on server load
 - Task scheduling
 
TODO:
 - Port to sponge
 - Fully abstract connected players
 - Scripting support
 
## Example
Registering a remote call is easy; just create the object. The call can be received by any server which has it registered. 
```Java
// Create your task during startup
RemoteCall<Result, Argument> task = new RemoteCall<Result, Argument>() {
    @Override
    public String run(Server server, Integer arg) {
        // This task runs on the target server
        if (some condition) {
            // Return a result
            return some result;
        }
        // Or don't return a result
        return null;
    }
// You can set a custom serializer if you want
// Otherwise it will use the default serializer
}.setSerializer(some serializer);
```

You can then use call it whenever you want:
```Java
int serverGroup = 0; // Target all groups
int serverId = 0; // Target all servers in that group
Argument arg = <some argument>;

// Provide a runnable if you want to do something with the result.
task.call(serverGroup, serverId, arg, new RunnableVal2<Server, String>() {
    @Override
    public void run(Server server, Result response) {
        // Do something with the result or server?
    }
});
// Use `collect` or `any` instead of `call` to pass a result back.
```
Misc classes
```Java
Network network = RedEdit.get().getNetwork(); // Get the connected players/servers
PlayerListener playerListener = RedEdit.get().getPlayerListener(); // Schedule a task on player join (timeout: 10s)
TeleportUtil util = RedEdit.get().getTeleportUtil(); // Various teleportation function
RedEdit.get().getUserConfig(uuid); // Get a player's homes
RedEdit.get().getWarpConfig(); // Get the warps
```
